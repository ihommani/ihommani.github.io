# San José del Pacifico

San José del Pacifico is a small mexican town located in the Oaxaca state. 
Before leaving for Mexico I've planed to go there on the advice of querida Jazmin.
The place is famous for its unique location on the peak of the cerros making a natural wall of 3000 meters high for the clouds.
CLouds litterally suround the town, giving the impression of giant sheeps wandering in the montains.  
The place is good for two things. Hiking and dreaming.
You can easily go outside San José to find paths from which you can walk for hours in a beautiful forest and meet loggers and inhabitants
from the area.
Myst will find you too. 




# El turismo
We met a guy named Leonardo who told us more about the town. How it was before being famous, and how it occured. 
Not so long ago San José was a town amongst others. Not famous, where people lived without the influence of tourism.
It all begun 40 years ago. At that time people came to witness an eclipse because of the good spot the town was providing. 

They found the eclipse as expected but they also found something else. 
San José, thanks to its special climate, provides all the conditions for the "hongos" to grow.
Hongos is the  name given to a psychotrop mushrooms.
Starting from this discover, more people came. 
First, Hippies. They found a cheap and quiet place where they can find their inner peace. 
Their presence changed the mind of the inhabitants. 
San José used to be a place where chamanism was strong. We were told babies were stolen and sacrified to spirits by some sorcer.
There was strong beliefs in sorcery. The genders difference was also very defined in their own way. A married women could'nt approach 
men other than her husband.
Then they saw coming hippies with their own way of life.
Women dressing like men, men loving women.
At that time there were no touristic structures to host people. 
Moreover, tourists were looking for cheap places. 
But with time tourism amplified and structures began to appear.
Now it's a place with cabanas, where you can find a wide range of service. 
We found few hippies. They do not talk much tough. However tourism is more diversified now and San José is a good to go with you familly.
