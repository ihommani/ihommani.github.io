Summary: The main goal of this blog

The main goal of this blog is to present and share my vision on various topics.
It mainly provides technical reviews, linked with my personnal experience and my work.
Still, I also have other passions I would like to share.
Movies, games, travels, MMA among others.

The creation of this blog is to me the oppurtunity to enhance my understanding of these topics.
For the reader, it's a place to argue, express its opinion. All in all to exchange. 

Any idea of enhancement? Please tell me.
